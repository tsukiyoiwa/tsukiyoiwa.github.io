We express our heartfelt gratitude for your ongoing support of TSUKIYOIWA. With the invaluable backing of each of our esteemed patrons, TSUKIYOIWA is proudly celebrating its fifth anniversary since its grand opening.\n\nSince the conclusion of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, there has been a notable increase in global seafood demand, resulting in persistent upward trends in ingredient costs, particularly for King Crab and Snow Crab. The significant rise in King Crab prices and the volatility in its supply chain have posed considerable challenges for our procurement processes.\n\nTo uphold our commitment to quality and ensure the consistency of our service, TSUKI YO IWA has resolved to modify specific menu selections and pricing commencing April 1, 2024. Your understanding and patience are deeply valued as we endeavor to elevate your dining experience.Effective April 1st, there will be adjustments to the contents of our set menus as follows: [Kindly note the additional 10% service charge.] \n\n (Lunch Only) Crab Set: NTD 4,500  \n\nTSUKIYOIWA Kaiseki with Live Crab: NTD 6,800 \n\nKaiseki with Live King Crab: NTD 9,800\n\nKaiseki with Live Snow Crab: NTD 9,800\n\nKaiseki with Wagyu Beef & Live Snow Crab: NTD 11,200\n\nKaiseki with Live King Crab & Live Snow Crab: NTD 12,800 \n\nOur dedication to delivering exceptional service quality to our valued patrons remains unwavering.
