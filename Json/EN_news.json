        "text": "-Notice-\n\nThank you for your continued support of Tsukiyoiwa.To provide our guests with the freedom to choose their preferred water pairing with their meals, starting from November 1, 2024, the complimentary tea service will be changed with a water service at 150 TWD per person.\n\nInitially, we will offer three choices: San Pellegrino sparkling water, Acqua Panna mineral water, and Evian mineral water. The available selections may be updated periodically to complement our dishes.\n\n • Acqua Panna\n Sourced from the hills of Tuscany, Italy, Acqua Panna water takes 14 years to flow through the rocks beneath the rolling hills before arriving at the Panna Estate near Florence. Known for its balanced mineral content, it delivers a unique and pure taste, beloved by sommeliers, chefs, and consumers alike. It is one of the most widely used water brands in fine dining establishments worldwide. Acqua Panna also adheres to AWS (Alliance for Water Stewardship) standards, minimizing its environmental impact during production.\n• San Pellegrino\n\n Sourced from the Orobic Alps in northern Italy, San Pellegrino water is filtered and mineralized through layers of limestone and volcanic rock over 30 years before emerging in the town of San Pellegrino. Rich in minerals, it is classified as a hard water, but its balanced mineral composition and delicate bubbles give it an elegant and harmonious taste.\n • Evian\n\n Evian water originates in the French Alps, where it is filtered through glacial rocks and sediment layers over 15 years before emerging in the town of Évian-les-Bains at the foot of the Alps. With low sodium and nitrate content and a balanced composition of calcium, magnesium, and potassium, Evian has a neutral pH of 7.2, making it suitable for pregnant women and children. Its pure, fresh taste is complemented by subtle mineral notes and a gentle sweetness.\n\nWe invite you to visit Tsukiyoiwa and enjoy our exquisite cuisine while choosing your preferred water to create a personalized dining experience.\n\n"
